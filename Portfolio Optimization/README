                     Portfolio Optimization

Constructed the Minimum Variance Portfolio and optimized Tendency and Desired Portfolios using
a variance-covariance matrix. To assess risk, I applied Value at Risk (VaR) to quantify the 
maximum potential loss each portfolio could face over a specified period with a given confidence
level. 

Additionally, I utilized Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to simulate the price movements of
the portfolios and their individual assets over a three-month horizon, based on historical 
volatility and drift.
