Gaussian, Vine and Clayton Copulas were evaluated for their effectiveness in modeling dependency 
and Value at Risk (VaR) in Time Series. Clayton Copula excelled in extreme risk assessment due to 
its lower tail dependency capture. Vine Copula was less effective, possibly due to complexity. 
Covariance method lacked accuracy in extreme market conditions, highlighting the importance of 
copulas in risk management.
